# CI/CD Automation

- Change records to deploy --> Better automation through some Distributed Jenkins workflow

- Endeavor --> Scalability is relatively difficult compared to newer tools.

- Using Zowe ( are they tying into IDE such as VSCode for development if they are also using Idz?)

- How are we going to integrate with the x86 Testing?

What are the things that are keeping us from automation?

- Environment readiness
    - Need to have test data (have data in shared state, but people are using shared data)
    - They use mulesoft so there is only one testing environment 
    - They need to get all data set up that other people are using at the same time
    - They think that they don't have to do anything but they still ahve to understand what they need to test
    - They don't know the tooling as well
    - Get emails from people that "we should stop testing because we're too busy"
    - Applications:
        - We would expect CICS regions to grow relative to needs
        - Are new environments created for those needs? No, they're reusing existing pieces
  

IF I will automate a test, I want to be able to spin up a region, spin up a database that supports the region, and load
it with data
* Reusing an existing environment is very dangerous
